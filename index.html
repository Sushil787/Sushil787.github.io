        visit Nepal-2022</h3>
      <p>
      BeautifulNepal is a land of friendly and engaging people, where deities mingle with mortals and magnificent
      temples, monasteries and historical monuments can be found at almost every turn. This is the home of Sagarmatha
      “Goddess Mother of the World”, the iconic Mount Everest, and her snow-capped counterparts making up the
      weather-beaten Himalayas.
      

      From eight of the fourteen tallest mountains in the world to the flourishing Terai plains of Jhapa, you will be
      forgiven for having your camera glued to your hands at all times. To take in the wonders of the Himalayas, we
      recommend travelling to Dhulikhel , one of the most popular destinations to view this chain of giants. Nepal’s
      startling beauty is at its best in Pokhara , which has been the subject of many travel writers. Its pristine air,
      the spectacular backdrop of the snowy peaks of the Annapurna Range and the serene Phewa, Begnas and Rupa Lakes,
      makes this destination ‘the Jewel of the Himalaya’.
      
      For a walk on the wild side we suggest a Nepal tour to the Chitwan National Park . Chitwan translates to “heart of
      the jungle” and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The park is home to many endangered animals such as the
      one-horned rhino, royal Bengal tiger, gharial crocodile and fresh water gangetic dolphin. The Bardia National Park
      is the largest wildlife area in the Terai and protects 968 square kilometres of sal forest and grassland,
      including one of Asia’s largest stretches of tiger habitat.

      A Nepal tour wouldn’t be complete without exploring the fascinating Kathmandu Valley . Comprising of the three
      ancient cities of Kathmandu, Patan and Bhaktapur, the valley houses seven UNESCO World Heritage Sites and is also
      home to a myriad of monuments, sculptures, artistic temples and magnificent artworks.

      Be sure to visit Kathmandu’s Durbar Square (the historic seat of royalty), home to the Hanuman Dhoka, named after
      the monkey god, Hanuman. Follow this exploration with a stop at the Patan Durbar Square, which is located in the
      heart of Patan City and consists of three main chowks (squares). The Sundari Chowk holds a masterpiece of stone
      architecture, the Royal Bath called Tushahity, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Monument.

      Adventure tourism is one of Nepal’s biggest drawcards. This is the ideal destination for active travellers,
      offering activities for nature lovers and adrenaline seekers. While trekking, mountaineering and game viewing have
      long been popular, visitors can now also enjoy excursions such as rafting, biking, fishing, hot air ballooning and
      even bungee jumping.
